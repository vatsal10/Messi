				animation with live-action, is directed by Michael Bay, with Steven Spielberg 
				serving as executive producer. It is the first installment of the live-action 
				Transformers film series. It stars Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky, a teenager who 
				gets caught up in a war between the heroic Autobots and the villainous Decepticons
				, two factions of alien robots who can disguise themselves by transforming into 
				everyday machinery, primarily vehicles. The Autobots intend to use the AllSpark,
				the object that created their robotic race, in an attempt to rebuild Cybertron and 
				end the war while the Decepticons desire control of the AllSpark with the intention
				of using it to build an army by giving life to the machines of Earth. Tyrese Gibson, 
				Josh Duhamel, Anthony Anderson, Megan Fox, Rachael Taylor, John Turturro, 
				and Jon Voight also star while voice actors Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving voice
				Optimus Prime and Megatron respectively. </p>
